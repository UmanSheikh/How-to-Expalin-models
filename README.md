# How to Explanation unexplainable models in Scikit-learn

Today in this code I am going to explain how to explain our AI model results or more simply how our model get that predicted value. For this we will use a python library called lime. It basically explains these predictions locally and it supports all models.
Now letâ€™s start.
Install 3 python libraries:

* Scikit-learn (for Machine Learning)
* Matplotlib (for visualizations)
* Lime (for Explanation)

Now follow the code and instructions.
